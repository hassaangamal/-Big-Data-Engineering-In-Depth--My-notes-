# Physical Layer 
- It's the lowest level in the database architecture.
- Describes *how data is physically stored* on storage devices.
- Details the specific data structures used.
- Allows modifications to the physical storage aspects without affecting the logical schema (the design of the database).
- **Modifications that can be made at the Physical Layer include:**
	- Using a new storage device.
	- Changing the data structure utilized for storage.
	- Altering the file type or adopting a different storage structure.
	- Modifying the method of data access.
	- Adjusting indexes to optimize performance.
	- Switching the compression algorithm or hashing technique to improve storage efficiency or security.
- **Example: Physical Layer in Databases**
    - The database holds product information.
    - At the physical layer, the following are described:
        - The storage mechanism and the size of the blocks (e.g., bytes, gigabytes, terabytes).
        - The total amount of memory used by the data.
    - This layer is usually abstracted from programmers, meaning they do not interact directly with the physical layer.
