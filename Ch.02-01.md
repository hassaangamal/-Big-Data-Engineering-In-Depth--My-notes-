# Data life cycle

- **Data as a Product**: This implies that data is not just raw information; it is processed, packaged, and maintained to serve specific functions, similar to a product in the market.

- **Life-Cycle of a Data Product :** This refers to the various stages that a data product goes through from its initial conception to its eventual archiving or disposal.

- **Question, Idea, or Service**: This is the conceptual phase where the need for data is identified. It could be a question that needs answering, an idea for a new product or service, or a requirement from an existing service.

- **Identify the Source of Information and the Data Type**: Here, one must determine where the data will come from and what kind of data it will be (structured, unstructured, semi-structured, etc.).

- **Document All Details Regarding the Data**: This step involves recording everything about the data, including its quality (accuracy, completeness, etc.), security measures in place to protect it, efficiency in terms of how it will be used, and access (who can access it and under what conditions).

- **Delivery Automation (Tools and Process) AKA DevOps Cycle**: Refers to the use of automated processes and tools to deliver data to users or systems. This is closely associated with DevOps, which is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development life cycle.

- **Data Architecture (Model Design and Rules)**: This involves designing the structure of the data storage system, including how data is organized, stored, accessed, and managed.

- **Extraction, Transformation, and Loading Process**: Commonly known as ETL, this is the process of extracting data from various sources, transforming it into a format suitable for analysis and reporting, and loading it into a final target database.

- **Business Intelligence (BI) or Data Discovery**: Business intelligence involves analyzing data to make informed business decisions. Data discovery is an ongoing process where data is continuously explored and analyzed to uncover new insights.

- **Integration and Publishing**: This stage involves integrating the data product with other systems and making it available to users, typically through reports, dashboards, or API endpoints.

- **Data Retention or Archiving Process ex: (Hot or Cold Storage)**: Finally, this refers to the policies and processes for retaining data for future use or regulatory compliance. Data may be stored in 'hot' storage for immediate access or 'cold' storage for long-term archiving where immediate access is not required.
