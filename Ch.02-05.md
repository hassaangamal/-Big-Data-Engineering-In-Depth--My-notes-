# View Layer 
- It is the highest level in database architecture.
- Provides a specific view of the data based on the user’s role or requirements.
- It's tailored for different categories of users.
- Acts as the final interface between the user and the system.
- Accessibility to different views can be extended or restricted based on a user’s role within the organization.
- Not every view is available to all users, as access is controlled through authentication mechanisms.
- **View Layer example can be summarized:**
	- The database stores product information.
	- It could be configured to display sales data for a product within a specific geographical region.
	- Access to information about certain products might be restricted depending on the team or user roles.

- In summary this layer ensures that users see only the data that is pertinent to them, enhancing security and user experience.
